 * Provides the shared instance of AeroMapServices for the AeroMap SDK for iOS,

 * provide their connection AeroMapService.
 *
 * This is an opaque object. If your application often creates and destroys view
 * or service classes provided by the AeroMap SDK for iOS, it may be useful
 * to hold onto this object directly, as otherwise your connection to AeroMapService
 * may be restarted on a regular basis. It also may be useful to take this
 * object in advance of the first map creation, to reduce initial map creation
 * performance cost.
 *
 * This method will throw an exception if provideAPIKey: has not been called.
